# Welcome to my front end portfolio!

Here, you'll find some of my front end projects. Here I've listed them by folder, so you can look at what you're interested in.

## guess-country-capital

This is a project where a random country is picked from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and the user has to guess its capital. It implements jQuery and async functions to dynamically render the page, given user input.

## interactive-rating-component-main

This is a project from FrontEndMentor where I created a dynamic rating card via HTML form submission and JavaScript jQuery, following a set design schema.

## music-player

This is my pride and joy, a project that started off as a warm-up that turned into a project of its own. It is a react app that uses the use-audio library to play a selection of songs, with functional seek, fast forward/rewind, volume change, and song changes. It was a fascinating exercise in useEffect hooks in React.

Preview site: https://music-player-beryl.vercel.app (NOTE: It will take a second for this page to load due to the useEffect hooks being dependent on the sound object loading -- due to the delay in loading for use-sound, it is hard to avoid. It is less noticeable in a dev build using npm start, but once deployed to Vercel it seems that this performance issue is exacerbated.)

## product-preview-card-component-main

This is a project from FrontEndMentor where I created a static preview card with responsive design, following a set design schema.
