## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot about responsive design, as I hadn't implemented it in a project since it was introduced in our bootcamp. For instance, the css media block was new to me.

```
@media screen and (max-width: 500px){
.card{
        flex-direction: column;
        height: 800px;
    }

    .title{
        font-size: 26px;
    }

    .flavorText{
        font-size:12px;
    }

    .photo, .contentSection{
        width: 100%;
        height:50%;
    }

    .photo{
        background-image: url(images/image-product-mobile.jpg) no-repeat center;
        background-size: cover;
        width: 100%;
        height:50%;
    }
}
```

I had created it with desktop in mind, changed the viewport on my browser to a mobile phone, and marveled at how broken it looked. 

My solution to it was to add the following:

```
.card{
        flex-direction: column;
        height: 800px;
    }
```

Otherwise, the card div would just stick to a relative size of the viewport. 800px seemed to be the fair height for showing everything required.

### Continued development

I think that I want to learn more industry standards for scaling and responsive design. I intend to look into that more with both Udemy courses and other online resources that I can find.
